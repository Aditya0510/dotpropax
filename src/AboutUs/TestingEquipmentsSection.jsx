    title: "Coefficient of Friction",
    description:
      "A coefficient of friction is a value that shows the relationship between the force of friction between two objects and the normal reaction between the objects that are involved. It is a value that is sometimes used in physics to find an object's normal force or frictional force when other methods are unavailable.",

    title: "Opacity Tester",
    description:
      "Opacity is an important attribute for packaging materials. The opacity tester is used in packaging industry to check the opacity of packaging materials so that proper type of printing could be used on the materials. Proper detection of opacity can save a lot of money on inks and other expenses.",

    title: "Dart impact Tester",
    description:
      "Falling dart impact is a traditional method for evaluating the impact strength or toughness of a plastic film. This test uses a single dart configuration and a single drop height, while varying the weight of the dart. Test results can be used either as a quality control evaluation or for end use comparisons.",
